### Description

I always hated the way that the normal Visual Basic frame looked, it was so ugly so I made this one. It does pretty much everything that the normal frame does just with a different look. please vote & tell me what you think :)

P.S. Feel free to add on to this code & upload, id love to see what could be done with it.
